# Small introduction about me and this project
- Hey, 
- Am Kishan, 
- Coding whiz. 
- In my dimly lit room, am like a superhero, solving LeetCode puzzles with the energy of someone who had too much coffee. 
- My computer is like a battlefield, but instead of enemies, i am fighting bugs – those annoying mistakes in the code.

- I spends my day typing in languages like Swift and Java, with a bit of sarcasm thrown in. 
- As i sits at my desk, it looks a bit messy with all those empty coffee cups and dusty programming books.

- Imagine me as a character in a story where the problems i solves are like villains, and my code snippets are the heroes. 
- I don't brag about myself; I am just a regular person trying to figure out the challenges of LeetCode. 
- So, here's to hoping your code is free of bugs, and your solutions are as clever as my jokes. Happy coding!
