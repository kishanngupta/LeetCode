# Small introduction about me and this project
- Hey, 
- Am Kishan😈, 
- Coding whiz🕵️‍♂️. 
- In my dimly lit room, am like a superhero🦹, solving LeetCode puzzles🧩 with the energy of someone who had too much coffee☕️. 
- My computer🖥️ is like a battlefield⚔️, but instead of enemies, i am fighting bugs🐞 – those annoying mistakes in the code🧑‍💻.

- I spends my day typing in languages like Swift☠︎ and Java☢️, with a bit of sarcasm thrown in. 
- As i sits at my desk, it looks a bit messy with all those empty coffee cups☕️ and dusty programming books📚.

- Imagine me as a character🦸 in a story where the problems i solves are like villains🧟‍♀️, and my code snippets are the heroes🦸. 
- I don't brag about myself🤷; I am just a regular person trying to figure out the challenges of LeetCode🤕. 
- So, here's to hoping your code is free of bugs, and your solutions are as clever as my jokes. Happy coding!🧑‍💻
